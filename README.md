Damage Threshold (DT) is an alternative way for armour to reduce incoming damage. Vanilla uses Damage Resistance (DR) which reduces damage by a percentage, while DT reduces damage by a flat amount, which makes it easier to calculate how much damage you'll take from any given weapon.

If anything needs adjustments, let me know. I highly recommend pairing this mod with <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nodami">NoDamI</a> and <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/combatedit">CombatEdit</a>.
